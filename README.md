This Rust program computes and lists all positive numbers less than a specified number n that are relatively prime to n. 
It employs the num-bigint library to handle huge integers and the Euclidean algorithm to determine coprimality.

The program contains: 
1. Big Integer Support: Utilizes the num-bigint library to handle large integers.
2. GCD Calculation: Computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. Relatively Prime Numbers: Lists all positive numbers less than n that are relatively prime to n.
